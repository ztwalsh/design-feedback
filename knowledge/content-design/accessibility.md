# Accessibility

Content plays a vital role is making a product that can be used by everyone, no matter their disability or circumstance. 

---

## Make it simple

Content should be simple, clear and reduce complexity.

- Using words like ‘you’ and ‘we’ instead of 3rd person makes things easier to understand

- Keep content no higher than 8th&hyphen;grade reading level

- Don’t use figures of speech or metaphors as they could be taken literally or not be understood in all cultures

- Use short paragraphs and sentences

- Include headings for scannability and understandability

- Use sentence case. Title case is harder to read, adds cognitive load

## Acronyms

Spell it out the first time it appears on the page with the acronym in brackets. You can use the acronym the other times it is mentioned.

## Consistent use of terminology

Consistency is key to a great experience.

- Do not use various terms for the same thing. This is confusing to users.

## Error messages

  
| Column 1 | Column 2 |  
| --- | --- |  
| ✅ Prefer | **🚫 **Avoid |  
| Tell the user what happened and how to fix it. | Avoid technical jargon. They do not care about (and often do not understand) error codes or technical info. |  
| Use helper text in user error scenarios to help avoid getting an error message. |  |  


### Links

  
| Column 1 | Column 2 |  
| --- | --- |  
| ✅ Prefer | **🚫 **Avoid |  
| Screen readers often go through a page by its links. Link text should be helpful, in context, and unique. | Don’t use click &hyphen; not everyone is clicking |  
| Do use inclusive terms like learn, find out, explore, browse | Don’t use see/read &hyphen; not everyone is reading on their own or can see |  


## Inclusive language

### Disable/disabled

- To create more inclusive product language, avoid using "disabled" when referring to features, settings, or actions within the Zapier platform. This term can unintentionally reinforce negative associations with disability.

**Instead of "disabled," use:**

- **Turn off/Turned off** &hyphen; Clear action&hyphen;oriented language. Best used when there is an “on” or “enabled” element

- **Deactivated** &hyphen; For features that are no longer accessible or available

- **Off** &hyphen; Concise option when space is limited and when there is an “on” element

### Examples

  
| Column 1 | Column 2 |  
| --- | --- |  
| ✅ Prefer | **🚫 **Avoid |  
| Zap turned off  | Zap disabled |  
| Turn off notifications | Disable notifications |  
| This feature is deactivated | This feature is disabled |  


**Design & UX considerations:**

- Use toggle switches, radio buttons, or checkboxes to visually indicate state changes rather than relying solely on text label

- Consider iconography (on/off switches, checkmarks) to supplement text

- "Turn off" adds only one character compared to "disable"

**Exceptions**:

- Required by external APIs, third&hyphen;party integrations, or governing agencies

- Referencing technical specifications for a technical audience (i.e. Developer Platform)
