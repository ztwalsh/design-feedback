# Punctuation

---

## Apostrophes

Use apostrophes to represent omitted letters or numbers:

- Omitted numbers (’40s)

- Omitted letters (don’t, can’t, won’t)

- Verb contractions (it’s, you’re, we’re)

Use apostrophes to form possessives:

- Singular nouns: add *’s*, even if they end in *s* (merchant’s, bus’s)

- Plural nouns that don’t end in s: add *’s* (women’s, men’s)

- Plural nouns that end in s: add an apostrophe (boxes’, customers’)

## Use ampersands selectively

The ampersand (&) is often used in place of “and”, but it’s not great for accessibility. It also attracts attention to the least important part of the sentence. 

“And” is more inclusive, easier to read, and translates globally. Using "and" is more accessible because:

- Spelling out words requires less cognitive effort

- It’s easier to code

- It doesn't impede speech software

- It makes scanning easier

You can use “&” in the following scenarios:

- Proper nouns, company names, or logos

- When space is limited

## Use the Oxford comma

Use the Oxford comma (also known as the serial comma) in sentences. There should be a comma after every list of 3 or more items (unless you’re using a bulleted or numbered list).

  
| Column 1 | Column 2 |  
| --- | --- |  
| ✅ Prefer | 🚫 Avoid |  
| Access your Zaps, Tables, and Interfaces. | Access your Zaps, Tables and Interfaces. |  


## Use exclamation marks sparingly!

Be conservative with how you use exclamation points. They can be useful in adding emphasis to a sentence, but an excessive amount of exclamation points can be desensitizing to a user. When everything is exciting, nothing is exciting.

  
| Column 1 | Column 2 |  
| --- | --- |  
| ✅ Prefer | 🚫 Avoid |  
| You’ve created your first Zap! | You’ve updated your Zap description! |  


## Skip periods most of the time

Avoiding unnecessary periods and other punctuation helps the reader scan text more easily. 

Avoid using periods to end single sentences, particularly in:

- Labels

- Tooltip text

- Bulleted lists

- Dialog body text

- Hyperlinked text

Use periods for:

- Multiple sentences

- Long or complex sentences, if it suits the context

- Any sentence followed by a link

## Question marks?

Avoid question marks wherever possible. Rework your content into affirmative statements wherever you can. 

It’s okay to use question marks if you don’t know the result of the question:

- “Did you forget your password?”

Don’t use question marks if:

- It’s the only option available: “Reset password”

- It’s an on/off option: “Show quantity box”

## Avoid using slashes

Instead of using slashes to combine words or ideas, use "and" or "or". This way, it is easier for the user to understand the intended meaning.
