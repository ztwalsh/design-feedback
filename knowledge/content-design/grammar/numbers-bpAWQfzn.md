# Numbers

---

Use numerals instead of written&hyphen;out numbers. 

  
| Column 1 | Column 2 |  
| --- | --- |  
| ✅ Prefer | 🚫 Avoid |  
| 9 | nine |  
| 100 | one hundred |  
| You have 5 tasks left. | You have five tasks left |  


Use commas for numbers with four or more digits. Avoid shortening numbers unless space is very limited and exact numbers can easily be found elsewhere (e.g. plan usage).

Use hyphens when writing phone numbers. Don’t use brackets, spaces, periods, or plus signs:

  
| Column 1 | Column 2 |  
| --- | --- |  
| ✅ Prefer | 🚫 Avoid |  
| 1&hyphen;514&hyphen;555&hyphen;1234 | 613.555.1234 |  
|  | 1&hyphen;(514)&hyphen;555&hyphen;1234 |  


For number ranges, use an en dash without a space on either side

  
| Column 1 | Column 2 |  
| --- | --- |  
| ✅ Prefer | 🚫 Avoid |  
| 5–10 products | 5 – 10 products |  
| October 15–31 | October 15 – 31 |  


For undefined upward ranges, use “and up” or “or more”

  
| Column 1 | Column 2 |  
| --- | --- |  
| ✅ Prefer | 🚫 Avoid |  
| $50.00 and up | $50.00+ |  
| 100 or more | >100 |  


For downward ranges, be specific.

  
| Column 1 | Column 2 |  
| --- | --- |  
| ✅ Prefer | 🚫 Avoid |  
| $0.00–$49.99 | $50.00 or less |
