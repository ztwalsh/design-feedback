# Pronouns

---

## Addressing users

Use second&hyphen;person pronouns like “you” and “your” to help the product feel like a conversation between the user and the UI.

| ✅ Prefer | 🚫 Avoid |  
| Recommended for you | My recommendations |  


First&hyphen;person, like “my” and “I,” can be used sparingly to indicate possession in UX content. Avoid using first person to speak on behalf of the product. In those cases, pronouns can often be removed altogether.

**Exception**: Some legal texts may merit the use of the first person to emphasize ownership in agreements.

Be careful to never combine first and second person as it can be confusing to see both forms of address in the same context.

## Chatbots

Chatbots, such as our in&hyphen;product “Copilot,” are trained on a refined style guide and should use first&hyphen;person pronouns to refer to the bot and second&hyphen;person pronouns to refer to users.
