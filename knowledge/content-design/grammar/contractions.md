# Contractions

## Use contractions, sometimes with caution

Contractions are abbreviated words, such as "can't", "aren't", and "you're", and help set a light and casual tone.

They help your writing sound friendly and more natural, which aligns with our voice. If you’re inclined to use a contraction like “we’re” instead of “we are” when you speak, use it in your writing too.

### Complex and negative contractions

Note that negative contractions can sometimes hinder the accessibility of content as they can be harder to read for some. If you’re concerned about the clarity of your message, you can separate the contraction into two words. For example, sometimes "do not" can give more emphasis than "don't” when caution is needed.
