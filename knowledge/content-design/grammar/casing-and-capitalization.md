# Casing & capitalization

---

## Use sentence case

When it comes to product content, we use sentence case in all instances—buttons, headers, links, etc. Only the first word of a sentence and proper nouns (e.g. names, locations) are capitalized.

Sentence case has been proven to be easier to read, and especially scan. Both title case and all caps are harder to read and should be avoided.

## Capitalization

The only words that should be capitalized within a sentence are **proper** **nouns**, official Zapier **product names** (e.g. Zapier Tables) or **branded names **(e.g. Zaps, Zapier Automation Platform) of which there are only a few.

When referring to units of a Zapier product, don’t capitalize the noun. The **only exception** to this rule is “Zaps,” as it’s a fabricated brand term that contributes to our brand equity.
