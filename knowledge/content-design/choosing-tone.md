# Choosing tone

Tone should always adapt based on context.

---

Choosing the right tone is especially critical when writing product content. These guidelines will help you decide what tone is appropriate for a given situation.

## Positive situations

Use a casual and enthusiastic tone. Be encouraging and offer users a next step where appropriate. Be careful about empty moments of celebration.

Be careful with humor, it can be hard to convey. Test your content with actual users to see how they respond, and when in doubt, keep a straight face.

| You saved 5 hours of time with Zapier this week! Treat yourself, you earned it. | You saved 5 hours of time with Zapier this week! BOO&hyphen;YEAH! |  


## Neutral situations

Use a casual, respectful, and matter&hyphen;of&hyphen;fact tone. While you don't need to be overly serious, avoid trying to be funny.

## Negative situations

[Alerts, warnings, and error messages](https://coda.io/d/_dH5LiS8Mxyt/_suolr#_luQJx) should be respectful and matter&hyphen;of&hyphen;fact, but shouldn't be overly formal. Don’t use exclamation marks or try to be funny.

Use clear, direct language to describe what’s gone wrong, what’s being done to address it (if applicable), and what the user can do. Avoid using "we" when referring to Zapier unless an actual human is involved.
