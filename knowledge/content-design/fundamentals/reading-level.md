## Write at a 7th&hyphen;grade reading level

More than 85% of average American adults will fully understand text written at an 8th&hyphen;grade level. We aim to write at a 7th&hyphen;grade reading level to further accommodate our users whose first language may not be English.

Tools like Grammarly and Hemingway help you test your reading level, as well as identify other places where writing can be improved to be clearer.
