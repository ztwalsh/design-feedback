# Active voice

---

## Active voice incites action 

The active voice helps users understand what they need to do and encourages them to take action. 

It’s also more concise and keeps the focus on the subject of the sentence.

### Exceptions

The passive voice can be used when you want to highlight the action instead of the subject or to make it clear that you didn’t personally take an action or make a decision. 

Passive voice can be used for error messages, warnings, or occasionally notifications.
