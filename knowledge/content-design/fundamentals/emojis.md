# Emojis 🤩

---

## Use emojis with care 

Emojis are tricky as their meanings can evolve and morph quickly, just look at Gen Z. 

Any emoji used in our products should:

- Be widely recognized and easy to understand

- Stay clear of slang connotations

- Be visible in both light and dark mode

- Use alt text

- Be paired with words and placed at the end of the phrase

Don’t use them in serious or somber situations and never use them to replace a word.
