# Content principles

---

Content is a fundamental element of a product. It’s the content that users interact with and respond to. Good product content allows people to do or find out what they need simply and quickly, using the most suitable content format. Think about designing with content, rather than just writing copy.

We have three main principles when crafting UI content:

  
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |  
| --- | --- | --- |  
| **Clear** | **Concise** | **Useful** |  
| Use plain language and avoid jargon. Pick simple and common words over complex ones. | Be efficient. Frontload key information and get to the point quickly. | Consider what the user needs to know or do, and write to help them achieve that. |  
| *Write for the user’s context* | *Respect the user’s time* | *Empower the user to take action* |  


## Be consistent with word choice

To help users understand key concepts and actions they can take, use consistent nouns (words used to identify people, places, or things) and verbs (action words) wherever possible.
