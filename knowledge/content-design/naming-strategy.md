# Naming strategy

---

# **Feature naming**

We want to limit the amount of “branded” feature names in and around our products as these can be disruptive to the user experience and risk diluting our overall brand equity.

Our naming strategy for features should follow these principles:

- **Drive continuity by using existing logic** → Do we refer to something similar elsewhere in the product?

- **Limit the introduction of new terms, concepts or names** → For example, “Zap Genie”.

- **Differentiate AI features or versions of features with a universal signifier** (see below).

- **Identify features in beta using the “Beta” tag component.**
