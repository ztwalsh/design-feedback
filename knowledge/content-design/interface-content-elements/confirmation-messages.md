# Confirmation messages

---

## Confirmation messages

- Use confirmation messages to reassure the user that the progress or results they expect is complete.

- Helpful when otherwise “invisible” processes are complete, or when the result of an action is delayed.

- Confirmation messages can be phrased as questions to help the UI feel conversation as long as they remain clear and concise.
