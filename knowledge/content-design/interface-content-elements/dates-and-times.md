## Dates and times

**Always spell out the day of the week and the month.** Use a numeral for the day of the month. Don’t add rd, th, or st to the end of your numeral. Never use M/D/Y or D/M/Y to represent dates. They are formatted differently depending on your location and can be confusing.

It's ok to abbreviate to the standard three&hyphen;letter forms when there are space constraints. Don’t add a period to the end of the abbreviated month.
