# Placeholder text

## Placeholder text

- Placeholder text (or ghost text) should provide additional guidance, context, or examples. It should never be the only context user’s are provided with. Field labels should be descriptive enough to guide the users even without additional context of the placeholder text.

- Placeholder text *does not* have to be used in every form field. If it is redundant with the label, remove it. Otherwise we risk training users to ignore our content.

- Placeholder text is not good for accessibility and adds to cognitive load due to it disappearing when you click in the field and the low contrast of the text.

- Add formatting to the label or under the field if applicable (&ast;to be reviewed with the form field component).

- Placeholder text should be minimal.
