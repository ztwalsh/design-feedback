# Headings

---

Headings and subheadings are titles and subtitles that refer to sections of the interface.

Headings and subheadings should be:


1. **Informative and descriptive**

- Highlight the most important concept or piece of information for merchants

- Help merchants understand what they’ll find in the section below

1. **Concise and scannable**

- Use simple, clear language

- Keep headings to a single sentence

- Avoid using punctuation such as periods, commas, or semicolons

- Write in sentence case (capitalize the first word and proper nouns only)

- Whether or not to use articles (“the,” “a,” “an”) in headings and subheadings depends on the type of message.
