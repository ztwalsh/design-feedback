# Typography Guidelines

## Font Hierarchy
- **Headings:** Use clear size differentiation (H1: 2rem+, H2: 1.5rem+, H3: 1.25rem+)
- **Body Text:** 1rem (16px) with 1.5 line-height minimum
- **Small Text:** Never go below 0.875rem (14px) for readability

## Readability
- Maximum line length: 65-75 characters for optimal reading
- Adequate spacing between paragraphs (1.5em minimum)
- High contrast between text and background
- Left-align body text (center-align sparingly)

## Font Weights
- Use font weights purposefully to create hierarchy
- Don't use more than 2-3 different weights
- Ensure sufficient contrast between weights

## Special Considerations
- Use system fonts when possible for performance
- Provide fallbacks for custom fonts
- Test readability on various screen sizes
