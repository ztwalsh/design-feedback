# Design Principles

## Clarity Over Cleverness
- Use straightforward, clear language and UI patterns
- Avoid unnecessary complexity or "clever" solutions
- Design should be self-explanatory without requiring explanation

## Consistency is Key
- Follow established design patterns and conventions
- Maintain consistent spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy
- Use a cohesive color palette throughout

## Progressive Disclosure
- Don't overwhelm users with all options at once
- Show advanced features only when needed
- Use clear visual hierarchy to guide user attention

## Accessibility First
- Minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text
- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- Provide clear focus states and visual feedback
- Use semantic HTML elements

## Performance Matters
- Optimize images and assets
- Minimize layout shifts and reflows
- Ensure fast load times
- Use loading states appropriately
